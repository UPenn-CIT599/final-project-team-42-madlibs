Project:  Literature Mad-Libs Game
General Project Area: Natural Language Processing

Team:  Ross Beck-MacNeil, Brenda Moss, Paul Lysander

Project Description:
Mad Libs is literature (word) game based on parts-of-speech word replacement. This project implements Mad Libs using natural language 
processing library (Stanford CoreNLP). The NLP library provides API for syntactic analysis and parsing of text into parts of speech, 
which is the critical component for Mad Libs. Player interacts with the game via GUI implemented in Swing. Data input (text for playing
the game) is based on literary passages from Project Gutenberg. All files (i.e. source code, literary text) for running the program 
are provided in GitHub repository.
